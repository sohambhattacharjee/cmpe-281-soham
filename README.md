# CMPE-281 Project 1

### Contribution
This is a closed project, not accepting any contributions

### Run Locally
`npm run build && npm run start`
This runs the express server that's proxying with AWS S3. If you only want to work on the UI, and can do without the connection to S3, then run `npm run start-dev`. This will enable hot-reloading and start react dev server.
